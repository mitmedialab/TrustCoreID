**MIT Media Lab Research Statement:** [https://law.mit.edu/blog/core-identity-blockchain-project](https://law.mit.edu/blog/core-identity-blockchain-project)

General inquiries include whether the following technologies individually or in any combination provide any measurable new benefits, costs or risks.

* Cryptographic digital signatures on otherwise standard web-based contracts
* Using cryptographic keys of a blockchain address for digital signatures on otherwise standard web-based contracts
* Using cryptographic keys in the physical possession of the person executing a digital signature on their own behalf


## Contextual Scenario: Blockchain-Pegged Digital Signatures for Otherwise Standard Digital Transactions

### Use Case 1.1 - Blockchain-Backed Digital Signatures on Contract for the Sale of Goods

**Use Case Fact Pattern:**

* Alice uses digital signatures and a blockchain address created with a commercial app 
* Alice decides to buy a used car from Bob for $8000 at a discount of $2,000 discount because Bob insists on cash payment.
* Alice and Bob agree on a standard contract in PDF format. 
* Alice uses her app to digitally sign the contract first, then Bob signs with a comparable commercia app. 
* Alice and Bob each have an exact copy of the mutually signed contract.
* Alice provides $8,000 in cash to Bob in exchange for Bob's car title and keys.
* Alice discovers the vehicle is made of realistic looking clay when she attempts to unlock the door.
* Alice sues Bob in Suffolk Superior Court in the City of Boston, where Alice lives.

**Use Case Evaluation Criteria:**

* Does use of the apps provide evidence of the contract that is admissible by Alice in court?
* Does use of the apps provide evidence of the contract that is enforceable against Bob?
* Does use of the apps provide a overall better or worse basis for ensuring predictable legal results?

### Use Case 1.2 - App Providers are US Federal Credit Unions

* Alice uses digital signatures and a blockchain address created with an app provided by her Credit Union. 
* Alice decides to buy a used car from Bob for $8000 at a discount of $2,000 discount because Bob insists on cash payment.
* Alice and Bob agree on a standard contract in PDF format. 
* Alice uses her app to digitally sign the contract first, then Bob signs with a comparable app from his Credit Union. 
* Alice and Bob each have an exact copy of the mutually signed contract.
* Alice provides $8,000 in cash to Bob in exchange for Bob's car title and keys.
* Alice discovers the vehicle is made of realistic looking clay when she attempts to unlock the door.
* Alice sues Bob in Suffolk Superior Court in the City of Boston, where Alice lives.

**Use Case Evaluation Criteria:**

* Does use of Federal Credit Unions as app providers result in any measurable new benefits, costs or risks?

### Use Case 1.1 - Blockchain-Backed Digital Signatures on Age and Ship-To Address of E-Commerce Consumer

[Note: explore impact on identity theft and other common fraud[

### Use Case 1.2 - App Providers are US Federal Credit Unions

[Note: Explore the impact of linking depository account holder (KYC/AML/etc) and Public Key on Blockchain]
